# VocalForge: Online Speech Generation and Training Platform

## Project Overview
VocalForge is an online platform designed for speech generation and voice model training. It aims to provide users with high-quality voice synthesis and customization without requiring local software installation. The platform features both a simplified mode for general users and an advanced mode for professionals who require more control over model parameters.

## Key Features
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Convert text into personalized speech.
- **Voice Model Training**: Upload voice samples to train custom voice models.
- **User Interfaces**:
  - Simplified UI: Automatically adjusts parameters for non-technical users.
  - Professional UI: Full control over model training and fine-tuning for experienced users.
  
## Target Users
- Content creators: Virtual voiceovers for videos, podcasts, and other media.
- Language learners: Realistic voice generation to improve pronunciation and practice intonation.
- Voice professionals: Customizable, high-quality voice models for actors, broadcasters, and artists.
- Educators: Personalized voices for creating online tutorials and conducting lessons.
- Individuals with disabilities: Assistive technology for communication through voice synthesis.

## Project Timeline
- **Weeks 1-4**: Design phase – Both teams work on the design of server-side and client-side components.
- **Weeks 5-6**: Coding phase – Implementation of core features based on the design.
- **Week 7**: Integration and testing – Server-side and client-side are integrated and tested.
- **Weeks 8-9**: Debugging and final adjustments – Resolve bugs and optimize the system for deployment.

## Team Members
- **Gao Renjun**: Model training and algorithm expert.
- **Luan Zhixiang**: Web development specialist.
- **Zeng Yunrui**: Python programming and algorithm developer.
- **Sun Ancheng**: Network programming and backend specialist.
- **Cai Dongting**: Algorithm design and user interface expert.
